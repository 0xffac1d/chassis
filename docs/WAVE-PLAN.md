# Multi-wave delivery plan

Staging map. Wave numbers advance when foundational contracts land; later waves may subdivide into multiple PRs without renaming the wave.

## Wave 1 — Foundations ✅

- Kind-discriminated `schemas/contract.schema.json` with semver metadata per ADR-0008.
- ADRs 0001–0016 accepted.
- Regenerated Rust + `@chassis/core-types` artifacts + schema fingerprint.
- Repository-root `CONTRACT.yaml` validating against the tightened schema.

## Wave 2 — Contract tooling ✅

- ADR-0017 (Rust fingerprint port) — `crates/chassis-core/src/fingerprint.rs`, parity-tested against `packages/chassis-types/scripts/fingerprint-schemas.mjs`.
- `crates/chassis-core/src/diff/` — contract-diff engine emitting `CH-DIFF-*` diagnostics (ADR-0019).
- `crates/chassis-core/src/exempt/` — exemption registry + sweeper + CODEOWNERS resolver (ADR-0020).
- 8 per-kind subschemas under `schemas/contract-kinds/`; `contract.schema.json` bumped to `3.0.0` (ADR-0021).
- 9 happy-path fixtures (one per kind plus `rust-minimal` and `typescript-vite`), 20 diff fixtures, 14 exempt fixtures.

## Wave 3 — Trace + drift + attestation ✅ (in tree; polish ongoing)

Shipped:

- `crates/chassis-core/src/trace/` — static claim scanner (ADR-0023, supersedes ADR-0005). Walks Rust + TypeScript sources, extracts the canonical `// @claim <id>` line-comment annotation (identical grammar for both languages), builds a graph of `claim_id → contract → implementing_files → covering_tests`. The pre-ADR-0023 TypeScript JSDoc form (`/** @claim ... */`) is rejected with `CH-TRACE-MALFORMED-CLAIM` so it cannot fail silently. JSON + Mermaid output. Rule IDs: `CH-TRACE-*`.
- `crates/chassis-core/src/drift/` — per-claim drift score from git history via `git2` (ADR-0024). Rule IDs: `CH-DRIFT-*`.
- `crates/chassis-core/src/attest/` — DSSE-style attestation envelope: assemble → sign (Ed25519) → verify (ADR-0022). Subject is the schema-manifest digest plus repo metadata. Rule IDs: `CH-ATTEST-*`.
- `crates/chassis-cli/` — single binary `chassis` exposing `validate`, `diff`, `exempt verify`, `trace [--mermaid]`, `drift`, `attest sign`, `attest verify`.
- `crates/chassis-jsonrpc/` — newline-delimited JSON-RPC 2.0 sidecar exposing six chassis methods (`validate_contract`, `diff_contracts`, `trace_claim`, `drift_report`, `release_gate`, `list_exemptions`). Explicitly **not** the Model Context Protocol.
- CI job `self-attest` runs `scripts/self-attest.sh` (trace → drift → attest sign → attest verify) and uploads the DSSE artifact.

Open polish items:

- Decide on signing transport beyond raw Ed25519 (cosign or in-toto) and capture in a Wave-3-close ADR.
- Drop unused imports in `crates/chassis-cli/src/main.rs` (the `validate_*_value` re-exports).
- Add a `doctor` subcommand to the CLI surface.

## Wave 4 — Operator interfaces

Reality-aligned scope:

- `chassis-cli` is the supported operator surface (shipped Wave 3). Wave 4 work here is feature polish: `doctor`, schema-manifest digest printing, optional `--repo` discovery beyond cwd.
- `chassis-jsonrpc` is the **experimental** machine surface (shipped Wave 3). Wave 4 decision: either add a real Model Context Protocol shim on top of the existing JSON-RPC methods, or formalize and version the JSON-RPC surface as a chassis-specific protocol. The shim option requires an ADR specifying the MCP method/capability mapping.
- TypeScript CLI is **not** currently planned. If a Node-only consumer needs `chassis-core` capability without the Rust toolchain, the path is a thin wrapper (NAPI or WASM) — captured in a future Wave 4 prep ADR if/when a consumer surfaces.

## Wave 5 — Self-application

In tree:

- `CONTRACT.yaml` at repo root with structured invariants and edge cases, all `declared`.
- `scripts/self-attest.sh` and the `self-attest` CI job exercise the full pipeline against this repo.
- Trace graph + drift report + DSSE envelope are produced for every push.

Remaining:

- Annotate every CONTRACT claim with at least one `@claim` marker in Rust or TypeScript source so the trace graph has no orphans for chassis itself.
- Add at least one real exemption to `.chassis/exemptions.yaml` exercising the registry.
- Promote claims past `declared` once the per-rung verifiers (per `docs/ASSURANCE-LADDER.md`) ship.
